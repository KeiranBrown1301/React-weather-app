# Weather App

In this app, we can see the daily weather from city selected from the dropdown, and then upon clicking the 7 day forecast sections we can see further details such as humidity, cloud cover, pressure and so on.

This is a very simple app built using React, I wanted to begin this in order to continue practice of fetching from APIs as well as just general practice with the language.
